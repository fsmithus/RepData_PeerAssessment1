## Loading and preprocessing the data

Set the working directory, then download, unzip, and read the activity data.
```{R}
setwd("~/Documents/Academic/DataScience/Reproduceable_Research/RepData_PeerAssessment1/")

download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip","repdata_data_activity.zip")
unzip("repdata_data_activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

First compute the average steps for each day.
``` {R}
daily.avg <- aggregate(list(steps = data$steps),list(date = cut.Date(as.Date(data$date),breaks="day")),mean)
print(daily.avg)
```


Then compute the average steps for all days.
``` {R}
mean(daily.avg$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
